# Contributing

To contribute, clone the [`react-tweet` repository](https://github.com/vercel-labs/react-tweet) and run the [Next.js test app](/next#running-the-test-app) to start an app locally that uses the [`react-tweet` package](https://github.com/vercel-labs/react-tweet/blob/main/packages/react-tweet). Any changes you make to the package will be reflected in the test app.

Once you're done making changes, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/vercel-labs/react-tweet/compare).

It's recommended to [open an issue](https://github.com/vercel-labs/react-tweet/issues/new) first before making any major changes to the package so that we can discuss the changes before you start working on them.
